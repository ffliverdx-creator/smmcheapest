-----------------------------------------------------
This is a starter project prepared for quick deployment on Vercel/Netlify.

IMPORTANT:
1) After uploading to Vercel, run `npm install` (Vercel does this automatically) then `npm run build`.
2) Tailwind & PostCSS are included as devDependencies. Vercel will install them during build.
3) For payment integration (Razorpay / Crypto) follow their docs and add server-side endpoints.
4) To change prices or services, edit src/SmmPanel.js or connect to a backend/admin API.

How to deploy on Vercel (manual upload):
- Go to vercel.com → New Project → Import → 'Deploy from ZIP or other' (upload this zip).
- Or push this repo to GitHub and import repository in Vercel.
